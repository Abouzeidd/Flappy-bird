# Flappy_bird_game

Flappy Bird is a simple yet challenging side-scrolling game where the player controls a bird attempting to fly through narrow gaps between sets of vertical pipes. The player must press a key to make the bird flap its wings and fly upward. If the player stops tapping, the bird starts falling due to gravity.

The goal is to navigate the bird through as many pipe gaps as possible without hitting the pipes or the ground. Each time the bird successfully passes through a gap, the player earns a point. The game becomes progressively more difficult as the speed increases, making it harder to maintain control of the bird.

If the bird hits a pipe or the ground, the game ends, and the player's score is displayed. It's an endless game, meaning it continues until the player crashes, making it highly addictive due to its simplicity and competitive scoring system.
